# compara-online-coding-test
ComparaOnline coding test solution by Claudio Novoa

The problem: https://github.com/comparaonline/interview-coding-test

Run `npm run test` to run the test suit and generate a coverage report


Run `npm run after-30-days` to print a demo 30 days price evolution to stdout


TODO:
- Maybe organize better the directory tree
- Put similar classes into one shared folder
- Get test coverage to 100% (currently at 96.23%)
- Use arrow functions @ classes methods (?) ES6 syntax
